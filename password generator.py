import random
from random import randint
#1. Creating an empty varaible to store the password in
password_generator= ''
#2.Since the code would run multiple times we would need to create a for loop
for i in range(20):
     i= chr(randint(25,99))
     password_generator= str(password_generator)+ i
print(password_generator)
#3.The range signifies the number of time we want the code to select a character from
# the range of values from 25 to 99
# The character function makes it easy for the random integer to include Alphabets and Special characters in the code
